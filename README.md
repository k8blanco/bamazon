# Bamazon Node App

* Bamazon is an Amazon-like storefront created with MySQL, Node, and JS.

* This app takes orders from customers, depletes stock from the store's inventory, and totals sales.

* As a Bamazon customer, you can see an inventory and make selections from there.
* As a Bamazon Manager, you can view products currently for sale, view low inventory, add additional products to low inventory, and list new products.
* As a Bamazon Supervisor, you can view product sales, overhead costs, and total sales by department.  You can also add new departments.

* Bamazon utilizes various pacakages including MySQL, Inquirer, CLI-Table, and Colors.
